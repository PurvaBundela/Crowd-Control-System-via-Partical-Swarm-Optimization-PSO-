# Crowd-Control-System-via-Partical-Swarm-Optimization-PSO-
•Presented a uniform conceptual model based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) to simulate the motion of all persons in a crowd according to the analogy between a swarm and a crowd

•This project mainly studies how to simulate the process of passengers’ evacuation under the circumstance of emergency evacuation and establishes the simulation model of the passengers based on the neighborhood particle swarm optimization algorithm
